<p>On the next screen, you will be asked whether you want to receive information about <b>air pollution levels</b>
  and the <b>number of life years lost because of air pollution</b> in your home district.</p>
  <br>
  In particular, you can choose between:
  <ul>
      <li>receiving the information</li>
      <li>not receiving the information</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p><b><u>How will your choice be implemented?</u></b></p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align=center style="width:20%"><img src="urn.jpg" width="80%"></td>
<td style="width:80%">The computer program will draw a ball from a virtual urn containing
<span style="color:green"><b>6 green</b></span> balls and <span style="color:red"><b>4 red</b></span> balls. <br>
<ul>
<li>If the computer draws a <span style="color:green"><b>green</b></span> ball, your choice will be implemented. (If you chose to receive the information, you will receive it. If you chose to not receive the information, you will not receive it.)</li>
<li>If the computer draws a <span style="color:red"><b>red</b></span> ball, your choice will <b>not</b> be implemented. (If you chose to receive the information, you will not receive it. If you chose to not receive it, you will receive it.)</li>

<p><b>In summary, it is more likely that your choice is implemented.</b></p>
