<p>On the next screen, you will be asked to indicate whether you prefer to receive information about <b>air pollution levels</b>
  and the <b>number of life years lost because of air pollution</b> in your home county,
  or whether you prefer not to receive any information.</p>

  <br>
  <p><b><u>How will your choice be implemented?</u></b></p>

<p>Whether your preferred choice is implemented or not is determined according
  to the following procedure:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align=center style="width:20%"><img src="urn.jpg" width="80%"></td>
<td style="width:80%">
  The computer program will draw a ball from a virtual urn containing
<span style="color:green"><b>6 green</b></span> balls and <span style="color:red"><b>4 red</b></span> balls. <br>
<ul>
<li>If the computer draws a <span style="color:green"><b>green</b></span> ball, your preferred choice will be implemented. (If you chose to receive the information, you will receive it. If you chose not to receive the information, you will not receive it.)</li>
<li>If the computer draws a <span style="color:red"><b>red</b></span> ball, your preferred choice will <b>not</b> be implemented. (If you chose to receive the information, you will not receive it. If you chose not to receive it, you will receive it.)</li>
</ul>
</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

<p><b>In summary, your preferred choice is more likely to be implemented.</b></p>
