              Think of all the people in the world and the air pollution in the places where they live.<br>
              Now image that all people in the world are grouped into 10 equally sized groups, depending on how large the <b>impact of air pollution
              is on their health.</b>
              <br><br>
              The figure below shows the 10 groups, ordered from left to right, from the biggest impact because of the most
              polluted air to the smallest impact because of the cleanest air.
