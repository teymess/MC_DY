      Next, we ask you to complete a <span style='color:#ee6933'><b>memory task</b></span>.
      <br><br>
      In this task, we test your memory ability.
      <br><br>
      On the following page, you will see a set of 20 different items which you should <b>memorize</b> to the best of your ability.
      <br><br>
      Each item is only displayed for <b>two seconds</b>.
      <br><br>
      Afterwards, we will test you memory by showing you a new set of items.
      For each new item, we will ask you whether it was part of the first set.
      We will reward each correct response with <b>$0.02</b>.
      <br><br>
      Please do not use pen and paper or a camera to take pictures of the items,
      but <b>only rely on your memory ability</b>.
      <br><br>
      When you are ready to start the memory task, click "Next".
