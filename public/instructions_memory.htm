      On the following page, you will see a set of 30 different items which you should <b>memorize</b> to the best of your ability.
      <br><br>
      Each item is only displayed for <b>two seconds</b>.
      <br><br>
      Afterwards, we will test you memory by showing you another set of items.
      For each item, we will ask you whether it was part of the first set.
      We will reward each correct response with <b>$<span id="bonus">-</span></b>.
      <br><br>
      <!-- Please do not use pen and paper or a camera to take pictures of the items, -->
      <!-- but <b>only rely on your memory ability</b>. -->
      <b>In this task, not only can you earn money, but you can actually learn something about your own memory capacity.</b>
