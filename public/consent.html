    <p>
        We would like to invite you to participate in an
        online survey about air pollution.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>You must be at least 18 years old to participate
            in this study.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>It is your choice whether to participate or not.
            </strong> Note that all questions are mandatory.
                However, you can stop at any time by closing your browser.
                <!-- Even if you begin the web-based survey, you
                can stop at any time by closing your browser. -->
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>We expect minimal risks for participants taking part in this study, such as
                  possible anxiety or discomfort regarding the topic of the research project.</strong> We anticipate that
                    it will take about
                    <em>10 minutes</em> to complete this
                    task. However, you will only be rewarded for completing
                    the task, not for the length of time you participate.
                    Please note that you have a maximum of <em>90 minutes</em> to
                    complete the survey. If you take longer, your survey will automatically
                    end and you will not receive any reward.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Beyond any applicable base reward, you can earn an additional reward (bonus) depending on decisions you take during the survey.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>All payments will be translated into panel points.</b> <br><br>

                    <b>Please note that it could take up to 4-6 weeks for the additional rewards to be granted.
                      Your bonus payment will be rounded up to the next highest 10 INR value.
                      Note also that it is up to the researcher’s discretion to assess whether your responses are rushed,
                      inattentive, or otherwise negligent which will result in the additional incentives being revoked without
                      the possibility of dispute.</b>

                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Your part in this survey is anonymized to the
                        researchers.</strong> The researchers involved
                        may have access to anonymized experimental research
                        records. However, because of the nature of electronic
                        systems, it is possible that respondents could be
                        identified by some electronic record associated with the
                        response. Neither the researchers, nor anyone involved with
                        this study will be capturing those data. Any reports or
                        publications based on this research will use only group
                        data and will not identify you or any individual as being
                        affiliated with this project. Your
                        data may also be stored on Dynata's servers, and the
                        data there are subject to the Dynata
                        Privacy Notice and Participation Agreement.
                        Upon publication in academic journals, the anonymized data might be
                        stored in a publicly accessible data repository.
